# Pose Estimation
Pose estimation is a computer vision technique that predicts and tracks the location of a person or object. This is done by looking at a combination of the pose and the orientation of a given person/object.

## Steps to use this:
* **Download Models**: 
    *   For Windows: Run downloadModels.sh
    *   For Linux: Run sudo bash downloadModels.sh

* After that run python poseEstimation.py -i <input Image/Video by default webcam> -w <width> -l <height> -th <threshold>
